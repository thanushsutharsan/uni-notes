# UniNotes - A Simplfied Notes App (FULL-STACK)

## Description

UniNotes is a full-stack Django web application designed for university students who want a simple and organised way to access revision resources and manage their own study notes.

The application combines a study-note marketplace with a personal revision area. Students can register for an account, browse available study notes, search for resources, filter notes by subject, view individual note details and purchase resources through Stripe Checkout. Once a payment has been successfully confirmed, the purchased resource is added to the student's account and can be accessed through their personal purchase library.

Registered users can also create and manage their own private revision notes. These notes can be created, viewed, edited and deleted by their owner, providing full CRUD functionality while ensuring that users cannot access or modify another student's private revision content.

UniNotes uses Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript together with a relational database, Django authentication and Stripe payment processing to provide a complete full-stack application.

## Purpose

The purpose of **UniNotes** is to provide university students with a simple and organised platform for accessing revision resources and managing their own study material. The application brings together two main areas of revision in one place: students can browse and purchase prepared study notes, while also creating and managing their own private revision notes through their account.

Users can search the available study-note library using keywords or filter resources by subject, allowing them to find relevant material more efficiently. Each study note has its own page containing information such as the subject, title, description and price. Registered users can purchase notes through Stripe Checkout, and completed purchases are stored within their account so that the resources can be accessed and downloaded again from the **My Purchases** section.

UniNotes also provides a personal revision area. Logged-in users can create revision notes containing a title, subject and written content, with the option to upload a supporting file. These notes can later be viewed, edited or deleted. This gives students a private space to organise their own revision alongside the resources they have purchased.

Overall, the purpose of the project is to create a useful study platform that makes revision resources easier to find, access and organise.
